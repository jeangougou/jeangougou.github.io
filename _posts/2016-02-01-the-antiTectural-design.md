## What is an architecure ?

In software design, as I assume in other specialized disciplines, before starting a new project there is a phase of analysis meant to highlight and expose potential pitfalls down the line of development and ensuring that everyone participating in building it is putting active effort towards the same goal.

As a landscape architect will not provide you with a design for a garden made of quicksand and thorns,
as a building architet will not provide you with a design to build a window-less staircase-less elevator-less ten stories building,
so you would expect the software architect to deliver a software architecture that would not contains obvious misunderstandings and mistakes.

Sadly that is not always the case and all the effort spent into building software can be misdirected or, in worst cases, even counter productive.

I'm going to be providing rule of thumbs and general assessment, trying to simplify the concepts. If you are looking for a more detailed explanation, please follow [Gregor Hohpe's article][Gregor Hohpe's article].

#### What is an architect supposed to produce then ?

Only documents and instructions ? Maybe, as long as they reflect a consistent architectural view.
The architecture is supposed to show the most convenient paths to minimize risk, to achieve the desired SLAs, to make the stakeholders happy, to fit the team skillset and the resources available.
Let me elaborate on these topics.
